# Tree Models

A decision tree uses a tree-like model to make predictions. It resembles an upside-down tree. It is also very similar to how you make decisions in real life: you ask a series of questions to arrive at a decision. These are the most intutive models. These models resembels our daya to day decision making scenareos. Tree based models are the basis for the most used intutitive models named as Random Forest.

## Decision Tree:

Decision Trees are the models mimic the way we make the decision. For example:

Types of Decision Trees:

1. **Binary Decision Tree**: Every node represents a decision, outcome is one of the two options. In case of Binary classification, each leaf of the tree represents one of the class.
2. **Multiway Decision Tree**: Every decision node results in more than two outcomes. 


### Regression Tree:
There are some cases where a linear regression model cannot be used to make predictions, such as when you want to divide the data set into multiple subsets because each subset has an independent trend corresponding to it. There, you use a decision tree model to make predictions because a tree regression model has the capability of splitting the data into multiple sets and assigning a linear regression model to each set independently.
