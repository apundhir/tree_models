# Tree Models

A decision tree uses a tree-like model to make predictions. It resembles an upside-down tree. It is also very similar to how you make decisions in real life: you ask a series of questions to arrive at a decision. These are the most intutive models. These models resembels our daya to day decision making scenareos. Tree based models are the basis for the most used intutitive models named as Random Forest.

## Decision Tree:

Decision Trees are the models mimic the way we make the decision. For example:

Types of Decision Trees:

1. **Binary Decision Tree**: Every node represents a decision, outcome is one of the two options. In case of Binary classification, each leaf of the tree represents one of the class.
2. **Multiway Decision Tree**: Every decision node results in more than two outcomes.
